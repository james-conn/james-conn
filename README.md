## Hello, I'm James

I'm interested in building reliable and secure systems in Rust.
I recently finished my batch at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com).

### My Projects
- [ssec-core](https://github.com/james-conn/ssec-core)
  - file format designed for password protected end-to-end encrypted file transfer
  - Rust library for streaming to/from the format
- [ssec-cli](https://github.com/james-conn/ssec-cli)
  - CLI tool for password protecting files
- [dvd-render](https://github.com/james-conn/dvd-render)
  - GPU accelerated text renderer for (headless) terminal emulators
